You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,
and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n,
 where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.





class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        # Initialize three pointers
        p1 = m - 1  # Pointer for the end of the initial elements in nums1
        p2 = n - 1  # Pointer for the end of nums2
        p = m + n - 1  # Pointer for the end of nums1 (including extra space)

        # Traverse from the back of nums1 and nums2, filling nums1 from the end
        while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
                p1 -= 1
            else:
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
                p2 -= 1
            p -= 1

        # Copy any remaining elements from nums2, if any
        nums1[:p2 + 1] = nums2[:p2 + 1]
