Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res,count =0,0
        for n in nums :
            if count ==0:
                res=n
            count+=(1 if n == res else -1)
        return res

Brief : For this question i tried to learn and implement the concept of Boyre-moore majority vote algorithm as i dont know the concept of hashmap till now i will try to learn it as soon as possible.
