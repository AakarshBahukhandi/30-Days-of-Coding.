Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.




class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Strip leading/trailing spaces, split into words, and reverse the list
          words = s.strip().split()
    
    # Step 2: Reverse the list of words
          words.reverse()
    
    # Step 3: Join the words with a single space and return the result
          return ' '.join(words)
